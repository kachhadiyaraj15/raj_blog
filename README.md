**Hello Everyone, I'm Raj Kachhadiya** ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as an **NLP Data Scientist** and also a lifelong student in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**. My passion lies in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Parallel Programming**â€”especially diving deep into the math that powers it all.

Right now, I'm exploring **CUDA Programming** to better understand and leverage GPU acceleration. I'll be sharing my learning journey, insights, and tips on the **CUDA pages** of this blogâ€”so stay tuned!

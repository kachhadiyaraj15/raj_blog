# 👋 Raj's Blog

**Hello Everyone, I'm Raj Kachhadiya** 👋

I'm currently working as an **NLP Data Scientist** and also a lifelong student in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**. My passion lies in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Parallel Programming**—especially diving deep into the math that powers it all (yes, I'm that person who enjoys what's behind the scenes! 😊).

Right now, I'm exploring **CUDA Programming** to better understand and leverage GPU acceleration. I'll be sharing my learning journey, insights, and tips on the **CUDA pages** of this blog—so stay tuned!
